*Visualization 5: Heatmap - Kirito*
The files for this viz are heatmap.js, axes.js, aggregator.js, and MigraineMain.js. This viz pulls data from nHanes which is
broad U.S. data that includes a lot of lifestyle and health data of U.S. citizens. It uses this to make a map that charts
some conditions onto a grid by age and PHQ-9 (mental unwellness) score. So you can see how older, unhappy people might be
impacted by chronic migraines more and then add in that they smoke or are divorced. The color is darker if more of the
respondents who fit the conditions reported chronic migraines as well
