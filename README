*Visualization 3: Regional map - Anne*
The files for this viz are vis3.js, brain.jpg, main.js, and the css file. This viz pulls data from a published estimate
of Alzheimer's disease dementia in the 50 U.S. states and 3142 counties, which uses data from the Chicago Health and Aging
Project and the 2020 bridged-race population estimates to calculate how many adults who are 65+ are living with Alzheimer's
and what percent of older adults are affected in each state. I grouped the data into the 4 major U.S regions and each region
is shown as a circle arranged on a cross. The size of each circle represents the number of cases per region and the color
shows the regional prevalence (percent of adults 65+ with Alzheimer's). The tooltip appears on hover and shows the top states
in that region by number of cases, so you can see how, for example, the Southern region have a the largest share of total cases.

*Visualization 5: Heatmap - Kirito*
The files for this viz are heatmap.js, axes.js, aggregator.js, and MigraineMain.js. This viz pulls data from nHanes which is
broad U.S. data that includes a lot of lifestyle and health data of U.S. citizens. It uses this to make a map that charts
some conditions onto a grid by age and PHQ-9 (mental unwellness) score. So you can see how older, unhappy people might be
impacted by chronic migraines more and then add in that they smoke or are divorced. The color is darker if more of the
respondents who fit the conditions reported chronic migraines as well
