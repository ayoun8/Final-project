        <div>
        <p> On this page we are going to explore several common brain diseases.
            Brain diseases are conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord, or nerves
            and disrupt how we think, move, feel, and function. They range from sudden events
            like stroke to chronic, progressive illnesses such as
            Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, as well
            as infections, tumors, traumatic brain injury, and headache
            disorders. Together, these conditions push a major global health burden across all ages,
            contributing to disability, mortality, and long-term caregiving needs. There are
            several factors that contribute to these brain diseases, and we are going to explore them
            throughout this page.

        <div id="vis1-root" class="viz-placeholder"></div>
        <p class="caption">Global Brain Condition Breakdown Pie Chart</p>
        <p> This chart illustrates the global distribution of major brain conditions by type.
            Migraines account for nearly half of all reported neurological conditions, emphasizing
            their widespread prevalence across populations. Alzheimer’s disease and dementia represent
            the second-largest share, reflecting the growing impact of aging populations worldwide.
            Stroke and epilepsy follow, contributing significantly to neurological disability and
            mortality. Less common disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and
            other neurological conditions together make up a small but important portion of the
            overall disease burden. We will explore some of these diseases more in this page and
            look at demographics associated with them.

        <h2>Alzheimer's Distribution by Gender and Race</h2>
        <div id="vis2-root" class="viz-placeholder"></div>
        <p class="caption">Alzheimer's Race and Gender Bar Graph</p>

        <p> This chart illustrates the distribution of Alzheimer’s disease cases by gender and race.
            White females represent the largest proportion of reported cases, highlighting both the
            higher prevalence among women and the demographic concentration in White populations.
            Black or African-American individuals show a smaller but notable share, consistent with
            studies suggesting varying diagnosis rates and access to care across racial groups. Male
            cases are significantly lower across all racial categories, reflecting the generally
            higher Alzheimer’s incidence in females. The visualization underscores the need for
            equitable diagnostic practices and inclusive research to better understand how gender and
            race influence Alzheimer’s risk and outcomes.

        <p>This map shows the MS distribution around the world</p>

        <p>
            This world map illustrates the global distribution of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with
            color intensity representing varying prevalence rates across regions. Higher rates of MS
            are concentrated in North America, Northern Europe, and Australia, indicated by the darker
            shades of blue. Lower prevalence is seen in regions closer to the equator and in developing
            countries, such as parts of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. This geographical pattern
            suggests a potential link between latitude, genetics, and environmental factors in influencing MS
            risk. Overall, the map provides a clear visual comparison of how MS affects populations unevenly
            across different parts of the world.

        <p>For our last look, we invite you to explore how different lifestyle and demographic factors relate to the
            number of people experiencing chronic migraines. The data covers U.S. citizens from 2017 to 2023 and includes
            information about marital status and smoking habits in a grid of mental unwellness by age of around 27,000
            respondents across the U.S. in many different walks of life.

        <h2>What is PHQ-9?</h2>
        <p>
            The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) is a short, 9-question survey used to measure depression
            severity. Higher numbers mean worse mental health. Each question corresponds to one of the DSM criteria for major depressive disorder and asks how
            often a person has experienced certain symptoms over the past two weeks (like little interest or pleasure in
            doing things, trouble sleeping, or feeling tired).
            Each item is scored from 0 to 3 for “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the days,” or “nearly
            every day”. Giving a total score from 0 to 27.

        <h2>Preventing Brain Diseases</h2>
        <p>There are so many factors we talked about here that impact many different types of brain diseases and physcial
        health issues. The goal here is to see how many different aspects of the way we live our lives can improve our chances
            at staying healthy for longer.
        Even though some risks come from factors out of our control, we can still work on proper diet, exercise, and mental and physical
        healthcare to greatly decrease susceptibility to brain diseases. These issues are ones to take on at an individual
        and societal level too. We should consider how equitable access is to these preventative measures and what
        we can do as a society to help everyone.</p>
        <p>Based on the charts in our project, it’s clear that demographic factors play a major role
            in shaping the prevalence of brain conditions. Regional and global patterns reveal that
            factors such as age distribution, lifestyle, genetics, and healthcare access significantly
            influence disease rates like Alzheimer’s and Multiple Sclerosis. For instance, older
            populations in the South and Northeast U.S. show higher Alzheimer’s rates, while MS
            prevalence is greater in higher-latitude countries with colder climates. These differences
            highlight how environmental exposure, diet, and socioeconomic conditions intersect with
            biological risk. Overall, understanding these demographic effects is essential for developing
            targeted prevention, awareness, and healthcare strategies that address the unique needs of each
            population.
