## Visualization 1: Pie Chart - Namrata
The files for this visualization are vis1.js and brain_disease_distribution.csv to illustrate the global
distribution of major neurological conditions. I used different colors for each disease/condition
to highlight its impact on the overall distribution of brain conditions and make sure it is
easy to visually distinguish the different conditions. Additionally, there is a tooltip to
highlight and specify the percentages for specific conditions to better understand the exact number
breakdowns.

## Visualization 2: Bar Chart - Namrata
The files for this visualization are vis2.js and alzheimers_gender_data.csv. Through this data,
I wanted to focus on both the racial and gender factors. I used two different colors to distinguish 
the genders for female and male. Additionally, with the axis titles, we are able to see the differnces
for races based on the lengths of the bar charts. Since the bar chart lengths are very easy to
distinguish it makes it easy for the user to understand the message of the chart. Additionally,
the tooltip allows the user to better understand and interpret the data.

## Visualization 3: Regional Map - Anne
The files for this viz are vis3.js, brain.jpg, main.js, and the css file. This viz pulls data from a published estimate
of Alzheimer's disease dementia in the 50 U.S. states and 3142 counties, which uses data from the Chicago Health and Aging
Project and the 2020 bridged-race population estimates to calculate how many adults who are 65+ are living with Alzheimer's
and what percent of older adults are affected in each state. I grouped the data into the 4 major U.S regions and each region
is shown as a circle arranged on a cross. The size of each circle represents the number of cases per region and the color
shows the regional prevalence (percent of adults 65+ with Alzheimer's). The tooltip appears on hover and shows the top states
in that region by number of cases, so you can see how, for example, the Southern region have a the largest share of total cases.

## Visualization 4: World Map - Aaron


## Visualization 5: Heatmap - Kirito
The files for this viz are heatmap.js, axes.js, aggregator.js, and MigraineMain.js. This viz pulls data from nHanes which is
broad U.S. data that includes a lot of lifestyle and health data of U.S. citizens. It uses this to make a map that charts
some conditions onto a grid by age and PHQ-9 (mental unwellness) score. So you can see how older, unhappy people might be
impacted by chronic migraines more and then add in that they smoke or are divorced. The color is darker if more of the
respondents who fit the conditions reported chronic migraines as well
